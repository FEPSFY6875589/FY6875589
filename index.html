    <p>
      Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) are a new type of solar technology 
      that is ready to be built in newer solar panels due to its high efficiency 
      benefits, turning more sunlight into electricity than traditional silicon panels.
      PSCs also have a different type of material making them much more flexible compared
      to silicon ones. This article looks at how PSCs work, their advantages and challenges.
      It also explores the interesting growth of solar panels in China, including huge projects
      on mountains like in Guizhou and Qinghai. It will also look in how PSCs could be incorporated
      into these solar panels inorder to accelerate or reduce costs long term.

    <div id='introduction_text'>
      <p>
        Solar energy is important nowadays due to its clean energy and that it
        never runs out. Traditional solar panels are made from silicon, but they
        are expensive to make and not very flexible. This is where Perovskite cells
        come into play, changing this. They are named after a mineral structure that
        can be printed like ink, making them cheap and easy to use on different surfaces (BBC Future, 2025).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2025, the rate of solar panel growth around the world will be rapid and almost exponential throughout
        the next decade and beyond, thus we need to find ways to reduce costs and make reliable and efficient solar
        panels inorder to minimise waste. China, a leading solar producer, is a major example of how this is possible
        in areas such as the Tibetan mountains where land is cheap and where sunlight is concentrated the most. This article
        explains Perovskite cells and how China's solar projects showcase the future and growth of solar energy.

      <h3>How Perovskite Cells Work</h3>
      <p>Pervoskite solar cells have a simple structure with many different layers.
        The main layer is the perovskite material which absorbs light and produces
        electricity. Other layers within this simple structure help move the electricity
        out: a hole transport layer, electron transport layer, and electrodes (InfinityPV, 2025).
      </p>

            Figure 1: The different layers within a Perovskite Solar Cell (PSC)
        </figcaption>
       </figure>
      
      <p>
        Compared to silicon, which is used in traditional solar panels now, PSCs are thinner and can
        be made at lower temperatures, reducing costs - potentially under £0.08 per watt (IDTechEx, 2025).
        In labs, single PSCs reach 26% efficiency or more, and when combined with silicon (tandem cells), they
        hit a nice figure of 36% (ScienceDirect, 2025). This shows that the efficiency of PSCs are much better than
        silicons 22%-24%. So how do the Perovskite solar cells produce energy? Light absorption is the first step of the
        process which creates seperated electrons and holes. Their difference between their energy levels is the maximum available
        voltage, which in turn excites electrons and thus generates electric power (ScienceDirect,2025).The layer which absorbs this
        light energy are called metal-halide perovskites (U.S Department Of Energy GOV, 2025).
      </p>

      <p>
        As years go by, scientists are constantly developing and improving PSCs. For example, Northwestern University added a special
        coating to make them last long in the heat and humid environments (Northwestern University, 2025). Companies like Trinasolar hit
        a record of 31.1% for tandem cells (silicon and PSCs combined) in April 2025 (BBC Future, 2025).
      </p>

      <h3>Advantages and challenges</h3>

      <p>
        PSCs have many good advantages. They are lightweight and bendy meaning that they can be applied to various objects such as buildings, cars, or
        even on windows (8MSolar, 2025). They also work well in low light, capturing as much sun light as possible. By 2035, experts predict that PSCs will
        produce 85 GW per year, meaning it has the capaability to power millions of homes (IDTechEx, 2025).
      </p>

      <p>
        Although there are many great features towards PSCs, problems can also arise. PSCs can break down in water or heat, and since they use lead, it also toxic, which
        is detrimental to the environment where the solar panels containing the PSCs are placed. Researchers are now trying to solve this issue with new materials like tin (Nature, 2025).
        Producing big panels without defects is hard, but companies in China are testing much larger ones (ScienceDirect, 2025). PSCs have a greater susceptibility to moisture and heat.

      <h3>China's amazing solar growth on mountains</h3>

      <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 40px auto; max-width: 680px;">
        <img src="solarpic.png" 
             alt="solarpic" 
             style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px; height: auto; border: 2px solid #536872; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,50,0.15);">
        <figcaption style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 12px; font-size: 16px; color: #003087; font-weight: 500;">
            Figure 2: China's fascinating solar panels on Mount Taihang
        </figcaption>
       </figure>

      <p>China is the leading produce of solar panels in the world. In the first 9 months of 2025, China installed 240.27 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity (APVIA, 2025).
        This amount of energy is large enough to power many countries, almost making the USA look very small, which has installed 30.2 GW. Insane.
      </p>

      <p>
        China primarily builds its solar panels on mountains because land is cheap and that high altitude places get more sun, thus increasing solar power. In Guizhou, a whole
        mountain range is covered with tons and tons of solar panels since 2015, that is about 10 million kW of energy that has been produced since then (Central Asia Climate Portal, 2025). 
        However, Guizhou' mountain range is not the only large solar panel area in China, there is an even much bigger place. Talatan park is this described place in Qinghai on the Tibetan plateau. Its
        162 square miles which is about 7 times the area of Manhattan in New York at 8200 feet high. Absurd. The thin air and strong sun makes this the best place to put solar panels, maximising the factors
        that greatly increases solar power. This places produces a whopping 30 billion kWh a year, which is sent 1000 miles to cities in China.
      </p>

      <p>
        So how can PSCs affect the growth and efficiency of these panels in these said areas? Well currently China is testing PSCs in these places. A 5 MW pilot plant in Qinghai shows that they work brilliantly
        in the cold, dry air since they have better lower operating temperatures (Huaneng Group, 2025).
      </p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        So can PSCs further accelerate the growth of solar energy by its continued research and development? PSCs can almost definitely achieve its potential to dramatically accelerate the global growth of solar panels. With
        the lab efficiencies reaching about 36% in silicon-PSC combined designs (tandem cells) and the costs falling toward £0.08 per watt, the technology is actually real and not another promise that doesn't deliver like other
        optimisitic or unrealistic projects. If these advances in technology continue in the solar industry - especially the move of 0% lead in these newer solar panels - PSCs could have the chance to cut the cost of solar electricity
        in half within the next decade or so. This set out cost reduction in the future would make solar power much more affordable almost everywhere around the globe, not just huge solar panel plants but also at homes. This alone would
        also speed up the replacement of existing gas and coal much much faster than the traditional silicon solar panels can achieve. China's mega farms on its Tibetan plateau are already proving that PSCs work in the real world. Perovskite
        technology could become that one piece of tech that could be the star behind the next terawatt of solar energy around the globe.
